# University of Melbourne Mathematics and Statistics Research Challenge Submission Code
This repository contains all code used in our submission to Topic S-03 for the [University of Melbourne Mathematics and Statistics Research Challenge 2025](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/engage/outreach/mathematics-and-statistics-research-challenge). Contributors consist of our team members: Daniel Rosina, Lucy O'Shea, and Felix Waters. Simulations are done in C++ to aid fast random number generation, while derived formulas and algorithms are done in Python to make use of numerical libraries like Numpy.
